One of the challenges of working with FPGAs and a computer is getting 
data into the FPGA and back to computer. When I working with XulA2-LX9
a Spartan 6 from Xilinx.  At the time Dan Gisselquist helped to get 1M baud 
between the XulA2-LX9 and RPi2B. 

I was using the ZipCPU by Dan Gisselquist.  
Dan Gisselquist has a version of the ZipCPU running on the ICOBOARD which is the 
same chip as the CATBOARD HX8k from Lattice.  I hope to use Dan's 
autofpga to get a version of ZipCPU runnning on the CATBOARD.

With MyHDL and RHEA in Python which can be used for Simulation and 
Iverilog was used for Co Simulation.   Dan Gisselquist perfers C and Verialator 
I started looking at a fork of Dan's wbuart32 https://github.com/develone/wbuart32.git,
I have been wanting to learn verilator for some time.
C and Verilator like MyHDL, RHEA, and Iverilog create Value Change Data vcd files.

This is a good starting point for students learning FPGA.  
git clone https://github.com/develone/wbuart32.git
cd wbuart32/
make
./linetest
Successfully read 31 characters: This is a UART testing string

PASS!
./speechtest

PASS!
In addition this provides a vcd file linetest.vcd that can be viewed with 
GTKWAVE
